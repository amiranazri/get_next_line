[scrape! ] [moaning ] - Huh? Sugar! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! [pop! ] Candy people explode when they get scared?! Not telling the candy people about the zombies is so important that you need to promise -- royal promise -- not to let anyone find out about the zombies -- ever.
Okay.
Sure.
No, Finn.
You have to Royal promise.
Yes, l royal promise.
Now, l must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum.
You keep the candyfolk distracted and ignorant.
Can you do that? Yes, your highness.
Good.
Don't tell anyone about the zombies -- never, ever.
Oh, wait.
Can l at least tell Jake? Tell me about what, dude? You know, about the outbreak of zom-- [chuckles ] All right, what's going on? Uhhhuh, nothing at all, buddy! [laughs nervously ] Hey, dude, l think you and Bubblegum are up to something.
Aah! [chuckles ] What? No! No way! Whoa! You guys are up to something! ls it some sort of prank? Can l get in on it? Who wants to play ''Truth or Dare''? Hmm.
Okay.
Chocoberry, you may choose someone to ask a deep truth or a saucy dare.
[French accent ] Mr.
Cupcake, truth or dare? Dare.
l dare you to take off your wrapper.
ALL: Ooooooh! [laughter ] Hey, seriously, man, l'm your bro.
Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time.

Everything is great.
[laughs nervously ] [crinkle! crinkle! ] Except for that.
Whoa! l didn't know he was chocolate.
Jake, tr-r-r-r-uth or dare? Truth.
Do you prefer chocolate or fudge? l can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause l'm a dog and they would probably kill me, buthmmprobably Neither! Finn, truth or dare? Dare! Ha ha! l dare you to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind.
What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together? ALL: Oooooooh! Ummuh the truth isuhh You promised you wouldn't frickin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn.
Uhhh the truth is that l'd rather play ''dodge socks''! [whip! splat! ] l'm not playing ''Dodge Socks'' till you stop dodging my questions.
Hey.
[sniffs ] Old Mr.
Creampuff? lsn't he dead? Uh, give me my sock back! ''Dodge Socks'' was a bad idea! Whoa! Look, dude, just tell me what's up, because you are crazier than a cannibal tonight.
[thinking ] Oh, my goodness.
Princess hasn't finished the equation, and the zombies are here! l, uh just want this slumber party to be super-fun! And if l did have something to tell you, then l would, in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so l won't, so it's cool.
Sugar! What? You lost me.
Uhhey you know what time it is? Adventure Time? No! Time for ''Seven Minutes in Heaven .
'' - You're first! - Really?! Lady Rainicorn, in the closet with Jake! [speaking Korean ] [laughs ] [laughs nervously ] Okay, okay, all right.
JAKE: But in seven minutes, l'm gonna come out there and make you spill your beans, Finn.
l can't hear you all the way in heaven! Sugar! Must eat sugar! Sugar! [thumping ] Um does anyone else hear that? What? [chuckles nervously ] Hear what? l-l don't hear anything.

'' [laughs nervously ] The game of barricades.
Come on -- let's block all the entrances and windows.
[all cheering ] Blockado! Blockado! All right, this is not a permanent solution.
[gasps ] Think, Finn.
How can you keep everyone from finding out? MANFRlED: Find out about what, Finn? Manfried! The talking piÃ±ata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea! Everybody, grab a stick! New game -- we're gonna smash some piÃ±atas! What?! Except for you, Manfried.
Oh, thank goodness.

Whew! Annyong! Seven minutes up yet? [chomp! munch! munch! ] Whoa! [panting ] What the nuts happened here?! Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and l raised from the dead.
Really?! Huh? J-Jake? What's going on? Wha? [gasps ] Finn! Did you break your royal promise?! Yeah, but l mean, all the zombies are dead.
The candy people won't freak out.
What's the big deal? This is really, really bad, Finn! You can't break royal promises -- never, ever, never, no matter what, forever! [rumble! ] The guardians of the royal promise are coming for us.
[rumble! rumble! ] [crash! ] [both screaming ] [robotic voice ] Finn the Human, you have broken a royal promise, for which the penalty is trial by fire.
[foosh! ] That's stupid.
Wait! He's my friend! lsn't there another option?! Yes.
Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less-hot trial.
You must now answer [robotic voice ] Math questions! Mathematical! Finn, you're terrible at math.
Aww! Nowsolve thls! [fwoom! ] [rapid beeping ] [groans ] Oh.
Wait, wait.
l thought of a better one.
Yes! ''2+2''! Solve it or die.
Uhh [both laugh ] Oh.
Correct.
[rattle! rattle! ] [shatter! shatter! ] FlNN: What's happening, Princess? You defeated the broken royal promise! The gumball guardians are resetting! BOTH: Whoa! Oof! Slam-a-cow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? l was all, ''4!'' [gasps ] That's it! The answer was so simple, l was too smart to see it! You're welcome.
''4'' is the last figure l need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.
[twinkle! pop! ] Golly! [candy people cheering ] Whoo-hoo! Yeah! This is messed up.
But sweet.
[speaking Korean ] Uncle chewy! Grandma! Former dead relative! Starchie! Mornin'.
Man, you broke a royal promise? You're nuts.
All's you had to say was that it was a royal secret.
l know what's up.
l hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.
Heck yeah! lf l break a royal promise, l get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake gumball guardians, and -- and -- All right, all right! And reverse death itself! Oh, you are adorable.
But keep your promises, okay? l will, Princess.
[gnaw! munch! slurp! chomp! ] Starchie, you're not a zombie.

Flesh is delicious.
You're delicious! Oh! [laughs ] Don't squeeze me.
